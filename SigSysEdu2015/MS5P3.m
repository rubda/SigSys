% Function M-file first-order backward difference transformation
% of a continuous-time filter described by B and A into a discrete-time filter. 
% INPUTS:   B = vector of continuous-time filter feedforward coefficients
%           A = vector of continuous-time filter feedback coefficients
%           T = sampling interval
% OUTPUTS:  Bd = vector of discrete-time filter feedforward coefficients
%           Ad = vector of discrete-time filter feedback coefficients
